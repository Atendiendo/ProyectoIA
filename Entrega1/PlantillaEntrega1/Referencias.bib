abstract = {This paper is concerned with an interesting variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) called a profitable tour problem (PTP). Unlike TSP, in PTP there is no need to visit all the cities, and each city is associated with a profit which the salesman gets in case he visits that city. Like TSP, a travel cost is incurred in visiting a city that depends on the city visited last before visiting the city in consideration. The goal of the problem is to maximize the total profit minus total travel cost. In this paper, we have proposed three methods, viz. a multi-start hyper-heuristic (MSHH), a multi-start iterated local search (MS-ILS) and a multi-start general variable neighborhood search (MS-GVNS) to solve the PTP. MSHH uses eight different low level heuristics, whereas MS-ILS and MS-GVNS utilize variable neighborhood descent search over five different neighborhoods for local search. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, a set of benchmark instances is generated based on the publicly available TSPLIB instances. Computational results on these instances show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.}

abstract = {In this paper we study the time-dependent profitable tour problem with resource constraints (TDPTPRC), a generalization of the profitable tour problem (PTP) which includes variable travel times to account for road congestion. In this problem, the set of customers to be served is not given and must be determined based on the profit collected when visited, keeping a balance with the total travel time. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that exploits the travel time function to reduce the size of a standard formulation from the literature. We derive four new families of valid inequalities and study the connections among them, as well as their associated separation problems. We develop a tailored Branch and Cut (BC) algorithm including these new families in addition to some well known valid inequalities from related problems. Computational results on four different problems, with alternative resources and objectives, show that the approach is flexible and effective. The algorithm achieves significant reductions in the computing times on benchmark instances from the related literature, and outperforms a recent method proposed for the time-dependent traveling salesman problem with time windows.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a real-world transportation problem arising from Industrial Internet platforms, where logistics companies selectively respond to requests for shipping products from manufacturers to customers. We formulate the problem as the capacitated profitable tour problem with cross-docking (CPTPC), which involves not only the selection of requests based on profit, but also the planning of vehicle routes with respect to capacitated constraints. The CPTPC, a generalization of the profitable tour problem and the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking, presents significant computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an effective hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) tailored to address the problem. The algorithm integrates a dedicated two-level edge assembly crossover operator to generate promising offspring solutions. Additionally, it incorporates a streamlined technique-driven local search approach to improve each solution. Empirical evaluations showcase the robust performance of the algorithm on benchmark instances, and experimental analyses provide insights into the key search components inherent in the proposed algorithm. In addition, we conduct a case study to assess the practical utility of our HGA in improving the operational efficiency and profitability of logistics companies.}
